budgetviz
---------

Python tool to draw in credit card and bank account statements and spit out a treemap_ of expenditures organized by category.

* Should install by just saying ``pip install /path/to/budgetviz/repository``
* Once installed, you can see it in action by ``cd`` ing to the ``examples`` directory and ``./run_me``
* ``budgetviz --help`` and looking at the ``config.yaml`` in ``examples`` should be enough to get started.  If not clear, please e-mail me.
